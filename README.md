# HolbertonSchool-Zero_Day

Here is my first repository that I created as a software engineer. 
Inside of this files and directories we were learning about how branches worked, how to create directories and files inside the terminal and connecting our github to the terminal.
Although the files are empty, the main focus of this part of the program was to learn the basics and getting familiar with the terminal before getting started to programming.
